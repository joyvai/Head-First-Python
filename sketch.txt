Man  Is this the right room for an argument?
Other : I've told you once.
Man  No you haven't!
Other Man said: Yes I have.
Man  When?
Other Man : Just now.
Man  No you didn't!
Other Man : Yes I did!
Man  You didn't!
Other Man : I'm telling you, I did!
Man  You did not!
Other Man Oh I'm sorry, is this a five minute argument, or the full half hour?
Man  Ah! (taking out his wallet and paying) Just the five minutes.
Other Man Just the five minutes. Thank you.
Other Man Anyway, I did.
Man You most certainly did not!
